# Binary Classifier CNN

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification using PyTorch. The model is designed to classify input images into one of two categories. The entire development process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, is presented in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of experimentation and visualization.

## Features
- Customizable CNN architecture built using PyTorch.
- Clear step-by-step implementation in Jupyter Notebook.
- Support for image preprocessing and data augmentation.
- Visualization of training progress (e.g., accuracy and loss curves).
- Modular design for easy experimentation and modification.
